<h1>Sticky - AI Powered Privilege Escalation!</h1>

This Python script is designed to check for SUID binaries on the local system and provide potential targets for privilege escalation. It utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to generate a privilege escalation script based on the SUID binaries found.
<h2>Usage</h2>

  Ensure you have set up an OpenAI API key and exported it as the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.
  Run the script by executing `python sticky.py`

<h2>Requirements</h2>

  - Python
  - OpenAI API Key

<h2>Setup</h2>

  Clone this repository to your local machine.
  
  Set up your OpenAI API key by exporting it as an environment variable:
    
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>

<h2>Script Explanation</h2>

  The script utilizes the subprocess module to execute shell commands for finding SUID binaries and making API requests to OpenAI.
  It checks for the presence of the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable and raises an exception if it's not set.
  
  SUID binaries are searched using the find command, specifically `find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null`.
  The list of SUID binaries found is passed as input to OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to generate a privilege escalation script based on the findings.
  The generated script is saved to a .sh file for execution.
